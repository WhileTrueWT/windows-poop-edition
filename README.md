# Windows Poop Edition
A semi-parodical operating system simulator, created with LÖVE

## Background
Windows Poop Edition is a series of fake OS simulators, canonically created by the company "CrapOS" and is inspired by the Windows Crap Edition series by the Computer Clan and other parody OS projects. The first version was created in PowerPoint during 2016-17, but in 2021 version 2.0 was created using the LÖVE2D engine, as were all subsequent versions since. Starting with version 3.0, Windows PE would start focusing less on the parodical aspect and more on having some actually semi-functioning features, while still retaining some parodical elements as well as general bugginess, in the spirit of CrapOS.

Yes, the code in here is messy, and you would be foolish to think I give a single shit about that.
