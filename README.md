# Windows Poop Edition
A semi-parodical operating system simulator, created with LÖVE

**NOTE: This repository is abandoned for the time being.** Development of the project itself will continue, but without any interaction with this Git repository. I am certain this comes off as an abhorrent and baffling decision to everyone ever, but trying to figure out Git has completely killed my motivation to work on this project. The mere thought of trying to decipher Git, unconditonally to my mental state or irritability levels, brings me more frustation than the thought of trying to learn other things. I am not sure why this is, but my brain being an enigma is nothing new to me. I will be able to develop this software in a much more enjoyable manner if all I have to worry about is writing the damn code.

## Background
Windows Poop Edition is a series of fake OS simulators, canonically created by the company "CrapOS" and is inspired by the Windows Crap Edition series by the Computer Clan and other parody OS projects. The first version was created in PowerPoint during 2016-17, but in 2021 version 2.0 was created using the LÖVE2D engine, as were all subsequent versions since. Starting with version 3.0, Windows PE would start focusing less on the parodical aspect and more on having some actually semi-functioning features, while still retaining some parodical elements as well as general bugginess, in the spirit of CrapOS.
