-- in the save directory, and see if they differ. if they do, the installer
-- should automatically be ran so that the new version can be installed.

-- the version of conf.lua that LÃ–VE executes is always the one from the source
-- directory. however within the actual program, the version of conf.lua from
-- the save directory should be read
